COULD
BE
KING
EVEN
FOR
A
DAY
I'D
TAKE
YOU
AS
MY
QUEEN
I'D
HAVE
IT
NO
OTHER
WAY
AND
OUR
LOVE
WOULD
RULE
THIS
KINGDOM
WE
HAD
MADE
TILL
THEN
I'D
BE
A
FOOL
WISHING
FOR
THE
DAY
THAT
I
CAN
CHANGE
THE
WORLD
I
WOULD
BE
THE
SUNLIGHT
IN
YOUR
UNIVERSE
YOU
WOULD
THINK
MY
LOVE
WAS
REALLY
SOMETHING
GOOD
BABY
IF
I
COULD
CHANGE
THE
WORLD
BABY
IF
I
COULD
CHANGE
THE
WORLD
I
COULD
CHANGE
THE
WORLD
I
WOULD
BE
THE

IN
YOUR
UNIVERSE

~20
I'VE
BEEN
WATCHING
YOU
FROM
A
FAR
FOR
AS
LONG
AS
I
CAN
REMEMBER
YOU'RE
ALL
A
REAL
MAN
COULD
NEED
AND
COULD
EVER
ASK
FOR
THIS
IS
MORE
THAN
A
CRUSH
YEAH
IT
WAS
HARLEM
AT
THE
RUCKUS
I
SAW
YOU
WITH
YOUR
MAN
A
SMILING
HUH
A
COACH
BAG
IN
YOUR
HAND
I
WAS
LAYING
IN
THE
COUPE
WITH
MY
HAT
TURNED
BACK
WE
CAUGHT
EYES
FOR
A
MOMENT
AND
THAT
WAS
THAT
SO
I
SKATED
OFF
AS
YOU
STROLLED
OFF
LOOKING
AT
YOUR
LEGS
GOD
DAMN
THEY
LOOK
SO
SOFT
(SO
FINE)
I
GOTTA
TAKE
YA
FROM
YOUR
MAN
THAT'S
MY
MISSION
IF
HIS
LOVE
IS
REAL
HE'S
GOT
TO
HANDLE
COMPETITION
YOU
ONLY
KNEW
HIM
FIVE
MONTHS
(THAT'S
RIGHT)
BESIDES
HE
DRINKS
TOO
MUCH
AND
SMOKES
TOO
MANY
BLUNTS
AND
I'LL
BE
WORKING
OUT
EVERYDAY
THINKIN'
ABOUT
YOU
LOOKING
AT
MY
OWN
EYES
IN
THE
REAR
VIEW
CATCHING
FLASHBACKS
OF
OUR
EYE
CONTACT
WISH
I
COULD
LAY
YOU
ON
YOUR
STOMACH
AND
CARESS
YOUR
BACK
I
WOULD
HOLD
YOU
IN
MY
ARMS
AND
EASE
YOUR
FEARS
I
CAN'T
BELIEVE
IT
I
AIN'T
HAD
A
CRUSH
IN
YEARS

THINK
IT'S
SAFE
FOR
YOU
TO
TRAVEL
THAT
WAY
AND
I
DON'T
WANT
TO
VIOLATE
YOUR
RELATIONSHIP
SO
I'LL
LAY
BACK
IN
THE
CUT
WITH
A
CRUSH
THAT'S
A
TRIP
STILL

CAN'T
STOP
ME
FROM
HAVING
DAYDREAMS
TONGUE'N

ICE
CREAM
KISSING
ON

SEARCHING

I
WONDER
ONE
DAY
COULD
IT

SIMPLE
DREAMS
COULD
TURN
INTO
REALITY
OUR
LOVE
WOULD
COME
DOWN
SO
NATURALLY
WE
WOULD
WALK
DOWN
THE
AISLE
OF
DESTINY
WOULD
YOUR
MAN
GET
HIS
HUSTLE
ON
GOT
YOUR
TYPE
SCARED
BREAK
YOUR
OFF
A
LITTLE
CHUMP
CHANGE
TO
DO
YOUR
HAIR

SEEMS
TO
BE
ENOUGH
TO
SATISFY
YOUR
NEEDS

LAST
WEEK
I
SAW
YA
AT
THE
MALL
STANDING
AT
THE
PAY
PHONE
ABOUT
TO
MAKE
A
CALL
I
HAD
A
VISION
IT
WAS
ME
ON
THE
OTHER
END
TELLING
YOU
COME
BY
AND
THEN
YOU
WALKED
IN
I
TOUCHED
YOU
GENTLY
WITH
MY
HANDS
WE
TALKED
ABOUT
TRAVELING
THE
DISTANT
LANDS
ESCAPING
ALL
THE
MADNESS
OUT
HERE
IN
THE
WORLD
BECOMING
MY
WIFE
NO
LONGER
MY
GIRL
THEN
YOU
LET
YOUR
DRESS
FALL
DOWN
TO
THE
FLOOR
(OH
YEAH)
I
KISSED
YOU
SOFTLY
AND
YOU
YEARNED
FOR
MORE
WE
EXPERIENCED
PLEASURE
UNPARALLELED
INTO
AN
OCEAN
OF
LOVE
WE
BOTH
FELL
SWIMMING
IN
THE
TIMELESS
CURRENTS
OF
PURE
BLISS
FANTASIES
INTERCHANGING
WITH
EACH
KISS
UNDYING
PASSION
UNITES
OUR
SOULS
TOGETHER
WE
SWIM
UNTIL
THE
POINT
OF
NO
CONTROL
BUT
IT'S
A
FANTASY
YOU
WON'T
COME
TRUE
WE
NEVER
EVEN
SPOKE
AND
YOUR
MAN
SWEARS
HE
LOVE
YOU
SO
I'M
GONNA
KEEP
ALL
THESE
FEELINGS
ASIDE
(THAT'S
RIGHT)
KEEP
MY
DREAMS
ALIVE
UNTIL
THE
RIGHT
TIME
AIN'T
NOTHING
LIKE
A
FANTASY
