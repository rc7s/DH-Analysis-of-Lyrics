Sorry
I
never
told
you
All
I
wanted
to
say
Now
it's
too
late
to
hold
you
'Cause
you've
flown
away
So
far
away
Never
had
I
imagined
Living
without
your
smile
Feeling
and
knowing
you
hear
me
It
keeps
me
alive
Alive
And
I
know
you're
shining
down
on
me
from
heaven
Like
so
many
friends
we've
lost
along
the
way
And
I
know
eventually
we'll
be
together
One
sweet
day
Darling
I
never
showed
you
Assumed
you'd
always
be
there
I,
I
took
your
presence
for
granted
But
I
always
cared
And
I
miss
the
love
we
shared
And
I
know
you're
shining
down
on
me
from
heaven
Like
so
many
friends
we've
lost
along
the
way
And
I
know
eventually
we'll
be
together
One
sweet
day
Although
the
sun
will
never
shine
the
same
I'll
always
look
to
a
brighter
day
Lord
I
know
when
I
lay
me
down
to
sleep
You
will
always
listen
as
I
pray
And
I
know
you're
shining
down
on
me
from
heaven
Like
so
many
friends
we've
lost
along
the
way
And
I
know
eventually
we'll
be
together
One
sweet
day
And
I
know
you're
shining
down
on
me
from
heaven
Like
so
many
friends
we've
lost
along
the
way
And
I
know
eventually
we'll
be
together
One
sweet
day
Sorry
I
never
told
you
All
I
wanted
to
say
~3
For
all
those
times
you
stood
by
me
For
all
the
truth
that
you
made
me
see
For
all
the
joy
you
brought
to
my
life
For
all
the
wrong
that
you
made
right
For
every
dream
you
made
come
true
For
all
the
love
I
found
in
you
I'll
be
forever
thankful
baby
You're
the
one
who
held
me
up
Never
let
me
fall
You're
the
one
who
saw
me
through
through
it
all
You
were
my
strength
when
I
was
weak
You
were
my
voice
when
I
couldn't
speak
You
were
my
eyes
when
I
couldn't
see
You
saw
the
best
there
was
in
me
Lifted
me
up
when
I
couldn't
reach
You
gave
me
faith
'cuz
you
believed
I'm
everything
I
am
Because
you
loved
me
You
gave
me
wings
and
made
me
fly
You
touched
my
hand
I
could
touch
the
sky
I
lost
my
faith,
you
gave
it
back
to
me
You
said
no
star
was
out
of
reach
You
stood
by
me
and
I
stood
tall
I
had
your
love
I
had
it
all
I'm
grateful
for
each
day
you
gave
me
Maybe
I
don't
know
that
much
But
I
know
this
much
is
true
I
was
blessed
because
I
was
loved
by
you
You
were
my
strength
when
I
was
weak
You
were
my
voice
when
I
couldn't
speak
You
were
my
eyes
when
I
couldn't
see
You
saw
the
best
there
was
in
me
Lifted
me
up
when
I
couldn't
reach
You
gave
me
faith
'coz
you
believed
I'm
everything
I
am
Because
you
loved
me
You
were
always
there
for
me
The
tender
wind
that
carried
me
A
light
in
the
dark
shining
your
love
into
my
life
You've
been
my
inspiration
Through
the
lies
you
were
the
truth
My
world
is
a
better
place
because
of
you
You
were
my
strength
when
I
was
weak
You
were
my
voice
when
I
couldn't
speak
You
were
my
eyes
when
I
couldn't

You
saw
the
best
there

you
believed
I'm
everything
I
am
Because
you
loved
me
I'm
everything
I
am
Because
you
loved
me
~4
I
pretend
that
I'm
glad
you
went
away
But
these
four
walls
close
in
more
every
day
And
I'm
dying
inside
and
nobody
knows
it
but
me
Like
a
clown
I
put
on
a
show
The
pain
is
real
even
if
nobody
knows
And
I'm
crying
inside
and
nobody
knows
it
but
me
Why
didn't
I
say
the
things
I
needed
to
say
How
could
I
let
my
angel
get
away
Now
my
world
is
just
a-tumblin'
down
I
can
say
it
so
clearly
but
you're
nowhere
around
The
night
are
lonely,
the
days
are
so
sad
And
I
just
keep
thinkin'
about
the
love
that
we
had
And
I'm
missing
you
and
nobody
knows
it
but
me
How
blue
can
I
get,
you
could
ask
my
heart
Just
like
a
jigsaw
puzzle
it's
been
torn
all
apart
A
million
words
couldn't
say
just
how
I
feel
A
million
years
from
now,
you
know,
I'll
be
loving
you
still
The
night
are
lonely,
the
days
are
so
sad
And
I
just
keep
thinkin'
about
the
love
that
we
had
And
I'm
missing
you
and
nobody
knows
it
but
me
The
night
are
lonely,
the
days
are
so
sad
And
I
just
keep
thinkin'
about
the
love
that
we
had
And
I'm
missing
you
and
nobody
knows
it
but
me

We
were

one
babe
For
a
moment
in
time
And

Feels
like
I'm
standing
in
a
timeless
dream
Of
light
mists
of
pale
amber
rose
Feels
like
I'm
lost
in
a
deep
cloud
of
heavenly
scent
Touching,
discovering
you
Those
days
of
warm
rains
come
rushing
back
to
me
Miles
of
windless
summer
night
air
Secret
moments
shared
in
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
Out
of
the
stillness
Soft
spoken
words
Say
it,
say
it
again
I
love
you
always
forever
Near
and
far
closer
together
Everywhere
I
will
be
with
you
Everything
I
will
do
for
you
I
love
you
always
forever
Near
and
far
closer
together
Everywhere
I
will
be
with
you
Everything
I
will
do
for
you
You've
got
the
most
unbelievable
blue
eyes
I've
ever
seen
You've
got
me
almost
melting
away
As
we
lay
there
under
blue
sky
with
pure
white
stars
Exotic
sweetness
a
magical
time
Say
it,
say
it
again
I
love
you
always
forever
Near
and
far
closer
together
Everywhere
I
will
be
with
you
Everything
I
will
do
for
you
I
love
you
always
forever
Near
and
far
closer
together
Everywhere
I
will
be
with
you
Everything
I
will
do
for
you
Say
you'll
love,
love
me
forever
Never
stop,
never
whatever
Near
and
far
and
always
and
everywhere
and
everything
Say
you'll
love,
love
me
forever
Never
stop,
never

I'll
always
think
of
you
Inside
of
my
private
thoughts
I
can
imagine
you
Touching
my
private
parts
With
just
the
thought
of
you
I
can't
help
but
touch
myself
That's
why
I
want
you
so
bad
Just
one
night
of
Moonlight
with
you
there
beside
me
All
night
doin'
it
again
and
again
You
know
I
want
you
so
bad
Baby
baby
baby
baby
(baby
baby
baby
baby)
Oh
I
get
so
high
When
I'm
around
you
baby
I
can
touch
the
sky
You
make
my
temperature
rise
You're
makin'
me
high
Oh
baby
baby
baby
baby
Can't
get
my
mind
off
you
I
think
I
might
be
obsessed
The
very
thought
of
you
Makes
me
want
to
get
undressed
I
want
to
be
with
you
In
spite
of
what
my
heart
says
I
guess
I
want
you
too
bad
All
I
want
is
Moonlight
with
you
there
beside
me
All
night
doin'
it
again
and
again
You
know
I
want
you
so
bad
Baby
baby
baby
(baby
baby
baby
baby)
Oh
I
get
so
high
When
I'm
around
you
baby
I
can
touch
the
sky
You
make
my
temperature
rise
You're
makin'
me
high
Oh
(baby
baby
baby
baby)
I
want
to
feel
your
heart
and
soul
inside
of
me
Let's
make
a
deal
you
roll,
I
lick
And
we
can
go
flying
into
ecstasy
Oh
darlin'
you
and
me
Light
my
fire
Blow
my
flame
Take
me,
take
me,
take
me
away
Moonlight
with
you
there
beside
me
All
night
doin'
it
again
and
again
You
know
I
want
you
so
bad
Baby
baby
baby
(baby
baby
baby
baby)
Oh
I
get
so
high
When
I'm
around
you
baby
I
can
touch
the
sky
You
make
my
temperature
rise
You're
makin'
me
high
Oh
(baby
baby
baby
baby)
Oh
I
get
so
high
When
I'm
around
you
baby
I
can
touch
the
sky
You
make
my
temperature
rise
You're
makin'
me
high
Oh
(baby
baby
baby
baby)
~10
Oh
yeah
baby
You
got
to
make
your
mind
up
Yeah,
Kut
Klose,
hear
me
out
You
know
you
are
my
lover
You
got
me
twisted
over
you
I
know
I
got
what
you
need
So
what
you
want
to
do
Baby,
baby
I
know
Baby
I
love
you
so
But
you
don't
feel
like
I
do
Tell
me
what
can
I
do
But
I
gotta
be
strong
You
did
me
wrong
When
I
thought
that
we
were
really
down
So
you
say
you
want
me
Make
up
your
mind
'Cause
I'm
not
gonna
be
here
for
long
Baby,
baby
in
time
Baby
I
know
you'll
find
That
what
you
needed
was
here
And
think
about
it
my
dear

Breaking
up
down
You
got
me
twisted
Thinking
about
the
way
that
things
use
to
be
When
It
was
you
and
me
girl
I
was
so
free
See
you
had
my
life
Like
Cupid
and
I
was
just
down
right
foolish
and
stupid
But
now
I
know
the
reason
for
the
pain
and
the
headaches
You
left
me
all
alone
now
I
can't
even
concentrate
I
guess
I'll
wait
for
the
day
until
you
come
back
Because
my
heart
is
where
your
love
is
at
You
got
me
twisted
